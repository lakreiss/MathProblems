The Euler Problems, which can be found at projecteuler.net, are a set of over 500 problems written to encourage
computer programmers and mathematicians to approach difficult problems from different angles. This can be 
interpreted to focus on maximizing aspects such as run-time, memory, etc. The website suggests abiding by the 
"1 minute rule," stating that runtime of the program should take no more than 1 minute on a moderately powered
computer.
