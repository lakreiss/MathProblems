I originally created this package as a possible aspect of the computer game I was working on earlier.
However, I now see other applications such as helping elementary school students practice their arithmetic.

The program runs on an infinite loop of problem generating, with progress reports every 20 questions. 

One drawback of the program is that it currently only supports computer math, so dividing two integers always 
rounds down to the next integer instead of outputting decimal numbers or fractions.
